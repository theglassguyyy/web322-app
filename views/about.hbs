            <h2> About </h2> 
            <p>Hello! I am Aashish Sapkota, a passionate web development student currently enrolled at Seneca College. My journey into the world of technology has been driven by a love for creativity and problem-solving. I enjoy learning new programming languages and exploring the latest innovations in web technology. My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and help bring meaningful digital solutions to life.
<br><br>
My journey in web development began with a curiosity about how websites are built and a desire to make my ideas come to life in the digital world. I believe that a great website is not just functional, but also beautifully designed and intuitive for the user. This philosophy has guided my learning so far, and I strive to improve my skills every day.

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me diving deep into new tech trends, reading books on personal development, or enjoying a game of chess. I love connecting with other developers, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on projects that inspire creativity.
<br> <br>
My long-term vision is to contribute to the open-source community and be part of projects that create a positive impact on people's lives. Technology is a powerful tool, and I want to use it to make the world a better place. From working on small-scale applications to contributing to complex, large-scale systems, I am excited about every opportunity to learn and grow.

I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. If you have a project idea or just want to chat about technology, feel free to get in touch. I’m always open to new opportunities to connect and grow with like-minded people in the tech community. Together, we can create amazing things!.</p>         </article>
